# README

In this github repository, you'll see a couple of new kinds of files.

First, this file, the **README.md**.  
And second, a **.gitignore** file.

## README files

It's common practice to include a README file in your project folder where you
include text that explains to others what the project is about and how to use it.
Larger projects may have multiple README's in different places.

The **.md** extension on the file stands for **markdown**. Markdown is just a
fancier kind of text file, but your README can also just be a plain **.txt** file.

## .gitignore files

When working with Github, you commonly use a tool from your terminal (a.k.a. command line)
called **git**. Git is an extremely common tool in the software world, and you
will definitely come across it in your development journey (better sooner than later)!

Common use of git:

A. You create some code in your local coding environment/IDE (e.g. vscode, notepad++, etc.)  
B. You use git to push that code into a Github repository, like this one

You may also use it for things like:

- pulling other people's code from github into your local IDE
- saving different versions of your code on different "branches" that you can quickly swith between and compare
- saving snapshots (commits) of your code at different points in time, so if you make a mistake, you can always go back to a previous commit

*Another note*: You'll see I moved the style.css into an **assets** folder. It's
good practice to keep styling and media files (img, audio, video, etc.) in a separate
folder called assets. Once you start working on larger projects, you'll see all kinds
of new project folders that are used to keep things organized. It's important to use
good naming/organization practice while you're learning!
